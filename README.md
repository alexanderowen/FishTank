## Fish Tank  
This is a graphical rendering of a neon fish tank, or a 'glow tank'.  
The models were made in Blender 2.7 and they were rendered in VTK 7.  
Lighting, shading and vibrancy were implemented in VTK.  
### Build and Execution  
To compile, you must have cmake and VTK installed.  
- cmake, at least version 3.6  
- VTK, version 7.\*  

Inside the 'build' directory, run `cmake ..`  
This creates an executable which can be run with `./fishtank.app/.../fishtank`  
### Caveats  
- Compilation has been tested on MacOS 10.11; cmake offers cross-platform compilation, but this is untested.
